# Extractive_Text_Summariser
Extractive text summarizer is a tool designed to condense lengthy documents or articles by selecting and extracting the most important sentences or phrases while retaining the original context. It works by identifying key sentences that encapsulate the main ideas and essential information from the source text. Unlike abstractive summarizers, which generate new sentences, extractive summarizers rely on the existing content. This technology is widely used to help users quickly grasp the key points of a document, making it a valuable tool for researchers, journalists, and anyone seeking to efficiently digest large volumes of text.
